        <h2 className="main--body"> Dear Frens,

I am passionate about blockchain and crypto currencies.
I started my journey at the top of the market in early 2018, purchasing some BTC and ETH, and then went the rabbit-hole exchange my ETH for crazy shitcoins such as DRNG or SUBstratum...
Then bear market came and I thought to myself, man those crypto are a ponzi and useless crap.
In summer 2020 I saw some news about the Defi, it hooked me up a little, that finally there was a real use case, such as AAVE where you can lend/borrow your crypto assets. But I was still afraid to invest again and just stayed at the side walk.
But finally I Fomoed again into the cryptomarket when BTC hit its ath in Nov/Dec 2020.
After this date I went full crypto degen, followed dozen of twitter account, been in several discords, purchased tons of crypto, been in lots of defi scams, useless nft that ruged after minting, etc...But also good stuff, such as KSM/DOT parachains, several good 'ICOs', etc...
I got so immerged into the blockchain world that I learned how to code, JS/React/Solidity, always learning, it is amazing, whats web3.0 and so on. 
Those days I am really into some play2earn and investigating new layer 2 zkrollups. </h2>
